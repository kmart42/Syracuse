\begin{document}
\maketitle
The maximum number of goods to be produced is determined by the 
maximum flow algorithm. The factories can produce $g_{i}$ goods, 
so restrict the units of flow into the warehouses to the production from g. 
Also restrict the outflows form the warehouses by $w_{i}$. The intermediate
steps are all infinity.
