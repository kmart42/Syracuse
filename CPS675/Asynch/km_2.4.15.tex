\maketitle
In the median sort algorithm, if you pick a "good" $v$, teh array is expected to shrink by at least 25\%. \\
You must pick two $v$'s before you expect to find a "good" one. This is because the expectation of finding a good
$v$ is \(1\over 2\) and two choices result in \({1\over 2} + {1\over 2} = 1\).
