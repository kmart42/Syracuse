Claim: a directed graph has a cycle if and only if its DFS reveals a back edge.
\begin{proof} First, show that if DFS tree has a back edge, then the graph $G$
  has a cycle. A back edge is an edge from a descendent to one of its ancestors.
  So there is a path from $a$ to $d$ in the DFS tree, but now we have an edge from
  $d$ to $a$ (back edge). So, there is a cycle.\\\\
  Suppose $G$ has a cycle. Define $u$ to be the first node in the cycle that the
  DFS visits. Define node $v$ to be the node right before $u$ in the cycle.
  Because there is a path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$, $v$ will be a descendent of 
  $u$ in the tree. (node u was the first node in the cycle). That is going to
  make the edge from $v$ to $u$ a back edge. Thus, the tree has a back edge.
\end{proof}
