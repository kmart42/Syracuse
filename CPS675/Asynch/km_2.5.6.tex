\maketitle
The worst case running time for selection sort is also \(O(n^2)\) as it could potentially compare every element in the array 
against every other element in the array multiple times. Here it would need to make O(n) swaps as well. \\\\
The worst case running time occurs when the list is in reverse order, but it is still \(O(n^2)\).
