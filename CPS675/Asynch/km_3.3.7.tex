Claim: all nodes reachable from $u$ will be marked as visited.
\begin{proof} By induction, on distance form $u$. (for every node v, which is i
  reachable from u, there is some path from u to v).\\
  Let $k_{v}$ be teh distance from $u$ to $v$.\\
  Base case: $k_{V}$=0. (can get to $v$ in zero steps, so $v$ must equal u). So v=u.
  Thus u is marked as visited.\\
  IH: suppose all nodes distance $d$ from $u$ will marked. Show nodes $d$+1 distance
  from $u$ get marked. These nodes get explored when their neighbors, which are
  distance $d$ from $u$ get explored. So the nodes at distance $d$+1 from $u$
  get visited. 
\end{proof}
