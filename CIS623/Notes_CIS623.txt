Propositional logic does NOT have quantifiers (e.g., for all)
  Prediate logic can have qualifiers

wff does not necessarily mean valid (valid = true under all condiitons)
  for example, p: if p is assigned to false, it cannot be true

wff: well-formed formula
BNF: Backus-Naur Form

Unary operators bind most tightly (negation)
  and binds tighter than or, which binds tighter than implies
  and/or are left associative, implication is right associative

To start: use premise, axiom, or assumption

wff can be: satisfiable, unsatisfiable, valid

Logical consequene: just use a truth table
